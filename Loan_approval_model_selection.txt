Logistic
SVM
Random Forest

Model Selection basis : 
1.Response variable(Dependent variable) is categorical .
2.Random forest suggest the most important variables .
3.KNN not used because there are no parameters .
4.Naive bayes not used because not all the features are necessarily independent of each other . (e.g. - ApplicantIncome and Property_Area)
